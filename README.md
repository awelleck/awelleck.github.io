# personal-site
Basic start on personal website. Used [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) for my front-end framework. Icons for GitHub, LinkedIn, Stack Overflow, and mail from [Font Awesome](http://fontawesome.io/). Site font from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/). Dice edited using [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/en/).

## TODO
1. Dice image borders need to be cleaned up.
2. Need to get a picture for center of site.
